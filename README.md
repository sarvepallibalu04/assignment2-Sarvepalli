<h4> Mutton Biryani </h4>

**Mutton Biryani** is a bowl of full meal consisting **carbohydrates (rice), proteins and fibre(meat).** It has potential to fulfill all the requirements of a full meal single handedly. It's colourful appearance, rich garnishing , great aroma, mouth watering taste makes it more tempting. Tasty masala and juicy meat are the showstoppers, and they decide the taste of mutton biryani. These are the reasons why I like mutton biryani.
