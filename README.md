##Mutton Biryani##

**Mutton Biryani** is a bowl of full meal consisting **carbohydrates (rice), proteins and fibre(meat).** It has potential to fulfill all the requirements of a full meal single handedly. It's colourful appearance, rich garnishing , great aroma, mouth watering taste makes it more tempting. Tasty masala and juicy meat are the showstoppers, and they decide the taste of mutton biryani. These are the reasons why I like mutton biryani.

## Process of making mutton briyani
  
  1. Marinate the mutton with all the spices at least 8 hours to 12 hours in advance. If you are in a hurry you can also marinate for 1 hour but the longer your marinate, the flavor gets it and the meat becomes tender.
  2. Fried Onions makes the biryani moist. 
     1. Drain and keep aside.
     2. Cook the mutton till you see an oil layer on top.
  3. Rinse and soak the rice for about an hour in cold water.
  4. Fry the cashews and onions. Drain and keep aside.Add marinated meat let it cook to almost 75% done.Bring a big pot of water to a boil, season with salt and spices, and cook the rice to 50% doneness. Taste and adjust the flavor of the water as needed. Salt should be slightly more than what you normally have.
